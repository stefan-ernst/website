User Journeys have long since become part of modern product design. Focusing on the user experience allows us to design products more easily and place them better in the market.

If you search for the keyword UX Design or Journey Mapping, you will often find a picture in the following form.

Significantly, the process of Journey Mapping is always offline - which is not bad, it is a collaborative and creative process involving several people.

In the moment when the user journey is finally completed, many things are clear and all participants have a clear picture - but what follows is often unclear. The most problematic point is that the specification that has just been written reaches the design or development team as in a waterfall process, is implemented there and is no longer questioned.

* Is the user journey we have here correct at all?
* Have we forgotten anything?
* Has anything changed in the meantime?
* Is the used persona still the same and has the user journey possibly been verified with a new persona?

With our tool Journey Mapping for Jira we have set ourselves the goal to find a remedy.

Our top priority is that the user journey becomes the linchpin of your product development:

* The behavior of the user is mapped directly in Jira and can be viewed with a few clicks
* Incoherent user stories are given a context that can be understood through storytelling
* Gaps that become apparent during development can be reflected and verified in the User Journey
* If after some time a problem occurs, you can link it to the original User Journey to make it easier to fix.

We are convinced that the creative process "offline" has its place. But then - take your Post-Its and bring the User Journey to life. Your users will be grateful to you.
