User Journeys have long since become part of modern product design. Focusing on the user experience allows us to design products more easily and position them better in the market.

If you search for the keyword UX Design or Journey Mapping, you will often find pictures like this.

Interestingly, the process of Journey Mapping is done mostly offline - which is not bad, it is a collaborative and creative process involving several people.

The moment when you finally complete a user journey map, many things are clear and all participants have a picture of the user's behavior in their mind
- but what follows is often unclear. The biggest problem is that the specification once it reaches the design or development team is implemented and is no longer questioned.
There is many things that we should be asking ourselves when working with pre-written user journey maps:

* Is the user journey correct - at all?
* Have we forgotten anything?
* Has anything changed in the meantime?
* Is the used persona still the same and has the user journey possibly been verified with a new persona?

With our tool Journey Mapping for Jira we have set ourselves the goal to find a remedy.

Our priority is that the user journey becomes the linchpin of your product development:

* Map the behavior of the user directly to Jira issue and view it with instantly inside your issues
* Give incoherent user stories a context that can be understood through storytelling
* Gaps and questions that come up during development can be reflected and verified in the user journey map
* If after some time a problem occurs - you can link it to the original user journey map to make it easier to fix.

We are convinced that the creative process "offline" has its place.
Journey Mapping for Jira is a tool that helps you bring it to life.
