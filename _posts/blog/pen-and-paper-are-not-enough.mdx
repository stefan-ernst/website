### About User and Customer Journey Mapping

User Journeys have long since become part of modern product design.
Focusing on the user experience allows us to design products more easily and position them better in the market - mainly because you
actually capture the users intentions and not design a product without validating it against real-world requirement (by the way: a great
way to do a journey mapping workshop is to include the actual users or interview them beforehand)

If you search for the keyword UX Design or Journey Mapping, you will often find pictures like this.

As visualized, the process of Journey Mapping is done mostly offline - which is not bad in itself - it is a collaborative and creative process after all.
Journey Mapping workshops build a shared understanding and you give all participants the opportunity to identify with the actual user of your products.

### Happily ever after?

The moment when you finally complete a user journey map, many things are clear and all participants have a picture of the user's behavior in their mind
but what follows is often unclear. The biggest problem is that the specification once it reaches the design or development team is implemented and is no longer questioned.
There is many things that we should be asking ourselves when working with pre-written user journey maps:

* Is the user journey correct - at all?
* Have we forgotten anything?
* Has anything changed in the meantime?
* Is the persona still the same and has the user journey possibly been verified with a new persona?


### The way forward

We build Journey Mapping for Jira to close this gap.
Our priority is that the user journey becomes the linchpin of your product development:

* Map the behavior of the user directly to Jira issues and view it instantly inside the Jira issue view
* Give user stories a context that can be understood through storytelling
* Gaps and questions that come up during development can be reflected and verified in the user journey map
* If after some time a problem occurs - the user journey provides a lifeline to the original user requirements


Start by writing down the individual steps of the user's journey

You can then associate existing or new tickets with the journey map

The journey map is now in digital form right within Jira - and your team members will now have an easier time understanding the context of the linked user story.

We are convinced that the collaborative offline process has its place.
Journey Mapping for Jira is a tool that helps you bring it to life.
